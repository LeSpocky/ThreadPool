/**
 * @class template class for advanced pointer reference object
 * Sometimes it is useful to reference a non shared object(parent) into another object(child).
 * But here is the problem on external deletion of the parent while the child
 * is in queue or while the parent object is in use.
 *
 * So we can use this external reference template (as shared_ptr object ;-)) to store
 * the normal pointer reference and a mutex member variable.
 *
 * The "stored" object (parent) has to reset its pointer reference in its own copy of the parameter object.
 * So all other objects(childs) know that the parent reference is not valid anymore. On each call
 * of the referenced object the caller has to lock the reference (thread safe).

/**
 * Interface class for automatic handling of initiating and resetting of reference object
 * As long the parent object is alive, the reference object ("sp_reference") holds the correct
 * reference. This shared object can be provided to other object. But on the destructor call
 * the parent object resets the reference object -> all other child objects will be updated too.
 *
 * This is a little workaround to have sth. like the share_from_this feature, which is only working if
 * the parent object is created as shared object. So you can use pseudo shared pointer reference within
 * non shared objects.
