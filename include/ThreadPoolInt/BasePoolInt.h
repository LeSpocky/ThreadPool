 * @brief	Base Interface for a "Threadpool". Therefore within this file the BasePool, WorkerThread and Functor
 * 		classes are defined. The Threadpool shall be used to store Functor
 * 		objects. These functors are handled by WorkerThreads.
 * 		The inherit class has to define the abstract functions with own or external thread and mutex
 * 		implementations (e.g. c++11, boost...).
