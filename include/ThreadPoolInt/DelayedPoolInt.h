/**
 * @file   DelayedThreadPool.h
 * @Author icke2063
 * @date   23.11.2013
 * @brief  	Interface for the delayed Threadpool extension
 * 		The idea is to have a extra list with Functor objects and a deadline timestamp.
 * 		If this deadline is over the Functor has to be added to normal Threadpool queue.
 * The function to check the timestamps has to be called continuously.
